# Pyapp

Its a practice snap for a simple python script.

It showcases:

 * Using [setup.py](setup.py) to place a script in the snap
 * Using build-on: in [snapcraft.yaml](snap/snapcraft.yaml) to build for different archs.
 * Building in a number of ways, including deployment (CD) to snapstore.

# Building
See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)
